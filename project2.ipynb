    "The analysis shows that Q3 is the busiest travel period, with top routes and airports driving most passengers. Fares and revenue are closely tied to distance, but some high-demand routes are underpriced, revealing pricing opportunities. COVID caused a major drop in total revenue, though average revenue per flight remained stable, highlighting the need for recovery strategies.\n",

    "Focus on high-demand routes: Add extra flights for NY → LA and Chicago → Miami during Q3 to meet peak demand.\n",

    "Adjust fares dynamically: Increase fares slightly on high-demand routes during summer, while offering discounts on underutilized flights in Q1/Q4.\n",

    "Optimize staffing and gates: Allocate more check-in counters and staff at busiest airports like JFK and O’Hare during Q3.\n",
